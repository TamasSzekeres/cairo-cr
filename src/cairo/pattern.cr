    # Create a new mesh pattern.
    #
    # Mesh patterns are tensor-product patch meshes (type 7 shadings in PDF).
    # Mesh patterns may also be used to create other types of shadings that are special cases of
    # tensor-product patch meshes such as Coons patch meshes (type 6 shading in PDF) and
    # Gouraud-shaded triangle meshes (type 4 and 5 shadings in PDF).
    #
    # Mesh patterns consist of one or more tensor-product patches, which should be defined before using the mesh pattern.
    # Using a mesh pattern with a partially defined patch as source or mask will put the context in an error status with
    # a status of `Status::InvalidMeshConstruction`.
    #
    # A tensor-product patch is defined by 4 BÃ©zier curves (side 0, 1, 2, 3) and by 4 additional control points (P0, P1, P2, P3)
    # that provide further control over the patch and complete the definition of the tensor-product patch.
    # The corner C0 is the first point of the patch.
    #
    # Degenerate sides are permitted so straight lines may be used. A zero length line on one side may be used to create 3 sided patches.
    # ```text
    #     C1       Side 1      C2
    #        +---------------+
    #        |               |
    #        |  P1       P2  |
    #        |               |
    # Side 0 |               | Side 2
    #        |               |
    #        |               |
    #        |  P0       P3  |
    #        |               |
    #        +---------------+
    #     C0       Side 3      C3
    # ```
    # Each patch is constructed by first calling `Pattern#begin_patch`, then `Pattern#move_to` to specify the first point in the patch (C0).
    # Then the sides are specified with calls to `Pattern#curve_to` and `Pattern#line_to`.
    #
    # The four additional control points (P0, P1, P2, P3) in a patch can be specified with `Pattern#set_control_point`.
    #
    # At each corner of the patch (C0, C1, C2, C3) a color may be specified with `Pattern#set_corner_color_rgb` or `Pattern#set_corner_color_rgba`.
    # Any corner whose color is not explicitly specified defaults to transparent black.
    #
    # A Coons patch is a special case of the tensor-product patch where the control points are implicitly defined by the sides of the patch.
    # The default value for any control point not specified is the implicit value for a Coons patch,
    # i.e. if no control points are specified the patch is a Coons patch.
    #
    # A triangle is a special case of the tensor-product patch where the control points are implicitly defined by the sides of the patch,
    # all the sides are lines and one of them has length 0, i.e. if the patch is specified using just 3 lines, it is a triangle.
    # If the corners connected by the 0-length side have the same color, the patch is a Gouraud-shaded triangle.
    #
    # Patches may be oriented differently to the above diagram. For example the first point could be at the top left.
    # The diagram only shows the relationship between the sides, corners and control points. Regardless of where the first point is located,
    # when specifying colors, corner 0 will always be the first point, corner 1 the point between side 0 and side 1 etc.
    #
    # Calling `Pattern#end_patch` completes the current patch. If less than 4 sides have been defined,
    # the first missing side is defined as a line from the current point to the first point of the patch (C0)
    # and the other sides are degenerate lines from C0 to C0. The corners between the added sides will all be coincident
    # with C0 of the patch and their color will be set to be the same as the color of C0.
    #
    # Additional patches may be added with additional calls to `Pattern#begin_patch`/`Pattern#end_patch`.

    #
    # When two patches overlap, the last one that has been added is drawn over the first one.
    #
    # When a patch folds over itself, points are sorted depending on their parameter coordinates inside the patch.
    # The *v* coordinate ranges from 0 to 1 when moving from side 3 to side 1; the *u* coordinate ranges from 0 to 1 when going from side 0 to side 1.
    #
    # Points with higher *v* coordinate hide points with lower *v* coordinate. When two points have the same *v* coordinate,
    # the one with higher *u* coordinate is above. This means that points nearer to side 1 are above points nearer to side 3;
    # when this is not sufficient to decide which point is above (for example when both points belong to side 1 or side 3)
    # points nearer to side 2 are above points nearer to side 0.
    #
    # For a complete definition of tensor-product patches, see the PDF specification (ISO32000), which describes the parametrization in detail.

    # This matrix is a transformation from user space to pattern space.

    # When a pattern is first created it always has the identity matrix for its transformation matrix,

    #
    # Important: Please NOTE that the direction of this transformation matrix is from user space to pattern space.
    # This means that if you imagine the flow from a pattern to user space (and on to device space),
    # then coordinates in that flow will be transformed by the inverse of the pattern matrix.
    #
    # For example, if you want to make a pattern appear twice as large as it does by default the correct code to use is:
    # ```
    # matrix.init_scale(0.5, 0.5)
    # pattern.matrix = matrix
    # ```
    #
    # Meanwhile, using values of 2.0 rather than 0.5 in the code above would cause the pattern to appear at half of its default size.
